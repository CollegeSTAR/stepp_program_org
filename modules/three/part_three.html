    </p>
    <p>
      Complete the formatting exercises below. When you finish, write a brief summary of your results, the challenges, and how you can become faster and more efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Complete the following formatting tasks in Microsoft Word:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open a new blank document and change page orientation from portrait to landscape.</li>
      <li>Set custom-size margins of 2” on the left and right and 0.5” on the top and bottom.</li>
      <li>Insert a header that says “Word Formatting Exercise.”</li>
      <li>Insert a footer that automatically lists the page number.</li>
      <li>On page 1, type 3 sentences about anything you want. Then press “Enter” until you reach the second page of the document.</li>
      <li>Cut and paste one of your sentences from page 1 to page 2 using either the mouse (right-click and select cut/paste) or the keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl-x and Ctrl-v).</li>
      <li>Change the font size of the first sentence to at least 24.</li>
      <li>Change the font color of the second sentence to something other than the default.</li>
      <li>Change the font/typeface of the third sentence to something other than the default.</li>
      <li>Choose a few key words in your sentences and apply one of the following emphases to each: bold, underline, italics, and highlight.</li>
      <li>On page 2, insert a clip art illustration. Resize it to fit on the page while still leaving room for your sentence. Center the clip art and center the sentence on that page.</li>
      <li>On page 1, insert a table that is 5 cells wide and 3 cells tall.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In Microsoft PowerPoint, create a new presentation that meets the following criteria:

    </ul>
    <p>
      Switch the view to see your presentation in the Slide Sorter and Notes Page views, and then switch it back to normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter Print Preview and set it to print the presentation as a handout with 3 slides per page. (You do not have to actually print the presentation.)
