    Campus resources can generally be divided into 3 categories:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Academic Resources</li>
      <li>Housing, Dining, and Transportation Resources</li>
      <li>Student Organization Resources</li>

    <div class="image_wrapper">
      <img src="/assets/images/graduation_cap.png" width="200px" height="200px"/>
    </div>
    <p>
    This category includes resources that benefit students academically. The types of resources are fairly standard, but details vary from school to school.
    </p>
    <p>
    Academic resources include (but are not limited to):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Library</li>
      <li>Tutoring, including general and subject-specific centers</li>
      <li>Advising</li>
      <li>Career Center</li>
      <li>Information Technology &amp; Computing</li>
      <li>Registrar</li>
      <li>Study Abroad</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>
    As we look more closely at these types of resources, keep in mind that the services that we mention will vary from campus to campus. Those listed are reasonably common offerings.

    <p>
    The library is an important resource that sometimes isn’t used enough by students. Many students don’t realize the depth and breadth of the services their library offers and are surprised to find support available for things they might not expect.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Traditional library services (e.g., lending books and other materials, reference services)</li>
      <li>Library databases</li>
      <li>Study environments</li>
      <li>Technology (e.g., Kindle, laptop)</li>
      <li>Research assistance</li>
      <li>Writing assistance (such as figuring out a good paper topic)</li>
      <li>Citation resources (generating the citations needed to correctly reference sources in papers)</li>
      <li>With current technology, many library resources can be accessed remotely. You may be able to use many of the library’s services from your dorm room or apartment.</li>

 Tutoring centers offer many resources to aid you in understanding. They are not only to be used when you are having difficulty in a class. Some of the most successful students use them proactively to run through and review main ideas from recent classes. Tutoring is tailored for your individual needs. Offerings could include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>One-on-one tutoring</li>
      <li>Group sessions</li>
      <li>Academic workshops</li>
      <li>Study skills training</li>
      <li>Tailored academic support</li>
      <li>Referrals to additional tutoring/academic resources if you need support beyond what they offer.</li>

  <h1>Academic Resources: Using College Tutoring Centers</h1>

  <div class="info_box">
    <p>
    Tutoring is for everyone, not just students who struggle. Tutoring is a resource to keep your grades up so you won’t need to bring them up.
    </p>
    <p>
    Expectations and guidelines for college-level tutoring:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Show up prepared, both physically (bring all materials you may need: syllabus, book, notes, laptop, flash drive) and mentally (be sure you have gone to class, listened attentively and taken notes).</li>
      <li>Study independently before tutoring: make a genuine effort to understand the material, read and review materials, and complete practice problems beforehand).</li>
      <li>If possible, bring specific questions about the material (know what you do and don’t understand, and be prepared to articulate specifically where you need help and what it is about the topic that’s confusing you).</li>
      <li>Actively participate. Use active listening and critical thinking skills to interact with the tutor; don’t sit back passively and wait for knowledge to be spoon-fed to you.</li>
      <li>Don’t wait until the last minute to attend tutoring. Last minute tutoring is great for clarifying a few points or getting in one more guided review, but not for cramming or learning entire concepts.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="table_wrapper">
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Tutors DO:</th>
          <th>Tutors DO NOT:</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Troubleshoot and clarify concepts that you didn’t understand during the first encounters with the material.</td>
          <td>Re-teach entire lessons or concepts.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Work through material with you and guide you toward the answers.</td>
          <td>Work through material for you or give you the answers.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Help you understand and apply concepts and complete problems similar to those on graded assignments. Explain concepts related to online quizzes or tests.</td>
          <td>Directly help you answer specific problems or questions on graded assignments or online quizzes and tests (especially in math).<br>
              <br>
              The exception to this is writing assistance. Writing tutors will generally provide direct help with your paper even though it will be turned in for a grade.

      <h1>Parents Chime In</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Review the use of tutoring in college and the specific types of tutoring offered.</li>
        <li>Compare the use of tutoring in high school to the use of tutoring in college. Talk about any positive outcomes that your student may have experienced from using tutoring in high school.</li>

    <p>
    Advisors help you to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand academic requirements and plan your course of study</li>
      <li>Select, schedule, and register for classes (in most cases they do not directly register you; that is your responsibility)</li>
      <li>Monitor your academic progress</li>
      <li>Interpret and follow academic guidelines</li>
      <li>Locate other resources needed to meet goals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Types of advisors:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>General (or pre-major) advisors</strong> work with you before you enter a major/degree program. They are trained to help you mostly through the process of completing foundational/core requirements along with all the other roles listed above. They also often have a working knowledge of most of the campus’s degree programs, so they can help guide you toward declaring a major.</li>
      <li><strong>Major advisors</strong> have specialized knowledge about a major/degree program. You’ll start working with these advisors once you have decided what program to enter. Although major advisors share some of the same advising roles as general advisors, they may be more focused on the issues that apply specifically to students in their own department.</li>
      <li>Students who are majoring in something but also working toward a “pre-professional” track in order to attend a specialized graduate school (e.g., pre-law or pre-med) may have a <strong>pre-professional advisor</strong> who helps them meet these requirements. Alternatively, their major advisor may help with that.</li>
      <li>Every university has its own way of organizing advisors, so check how the school that you are interested in assigns advisors.</li>

  <div class="info_box">
    <p>
    No matter what interests you, most campuses host lots of opportunities to have fun! These opportunities can play an integral role in your college experience. Participation increases your interaction with other students, and it may lead to increased learning and engagement in the college setting.
    </p>
    <p>
    Your peer group may be the most important influence upon your academic and personal development. Student organizations are diverse but have some characteristics in common. Extracurricular student organizations and activities:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Include any non-academic activity or organization</li>
      <li>Feature a diverse range of extracurricular activities</li>
      <li>Invite participation that helps to develop the “whole student.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Students may have many possible purposes for getting involved:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Entertainment and enjoyment</li>
      <li>Socialization; meeting friends; networking</li>
      <li>Gaining and improving skills</li>
      <li>Desire to volunteer or to serve others</li>
      <li>Resume-building (future employers may look for involvement in extracurricular activities because it shows a well-rounded individual who is able to balance work and pleasure).</li>

  <h1>Types of Student Organizations and Extracurricular Activities</h1>
  
  <div class="info_box">
    <p>
    Academic, professional, and honorary: Assist their members in gaining experience in their chosen occupational field, and aid members in their job search. Students meet to discuss pertinent issues related to their field of interest and to learn job-related skills in preparation for future success.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Groups related to a specific major/field (e.g., the American Marketing Association, the Student Education Association, and the Mathematics Society)</li>
      <li>Professional membership groups</li>
      <li>Academic honors groups.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Leadership:</strong> One of the most widespread types of extracurricular experience available on college campuses is student government. Students involved in governance organizations, such as student government and residence hall government, are typically elected by their peers to function as the “official voice” of students to university administration.
    </p>
    <p>
    Functions of these organization include allocating funds to other organizations, planning programs related to student interests, providing forums for discussion of student issues, and helping to build and sustain a successful campus community.
    </p>
    <p>
    These organizations may provide leadership on campus or in the community.
    </p>
    <p>
    Additional examples of campus governance organizations include honor councils, which seek to enforce a university’s honor code, and judiciary boards, where students hear disciplinary cases and render verdicts.

      <li>In Alternative Spring Break programs, students engage in community service projects, such as rebuilding homes, tutoring students, or planting trees during their college spring break.</li>
      <li>Additional service projects and organizations function throughout the year, including Alpha Phi Omega, Habitat for Humanity, and Circle K, which promotes service and volunteerism during the college years.</li>
