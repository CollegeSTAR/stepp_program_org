            <li>However, many colleges have an official attendance policy, and professors may choose to follow that attendance policy or use their own. In many college classes, students are allotted a specific number of absences for the semester, and students who exceed that number of absences fail the class.</li>
            <li>In addition, professors generally don’t offer make-up tests and are unlikely to review missed information. Therefore, even if there is no formal absence penalty, the missed information, missed assignments, and impact on teacher impressions can affect student grades.</li>

      <p>
      <strong>Review together:</strong> Many of the class and instructor examples emphasize the need for students to take responsibility for their own education. This is true in many instances, and will need to be discussed in detail.
      </p>
      <p>
      A big difference between many high school and college courses is the amount and depth of independent, critical thinking required of students. 
      </p>
      <p>
      College professors are more likely to simply present information without making the connections for the students, assuming that students will use their critical thinking skills and study time outside of class to draw connections and reach conclusions themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
      Many professors are excellent teachers. However, for college professors, it is more important for them to know their subject area extremely well than for them to know about teaching methods.
      </p>
      <p>
      Students who have difficulty learning from a professor in college must take steps on their own to learn the material, whether it’s from a classmate, a tutor, or independently. Some professors will adapt their teaching style if a student indicates they are having difficulty, but many will not.

In these settings, information will be provided without the heavy note-taking guidance that you might have experienced in high school.</li>
