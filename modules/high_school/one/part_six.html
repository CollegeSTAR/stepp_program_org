    <p>In this video, you will learn the difference between College
    and High School test-taking with some examples from LSU and their Center for Academic
    Success. With the right time management and organizational tips, as well as learning how to
    think critically, college freshmen can avoid feeling overwhelmed during the transition from high
    school to college.</p>

      <li>In Part IV of the High School vs. College module, we will discuss grades and testing in college. This is the final set of high school/college comparisons in Module 1.</li>
      <li>In this section, you will need to think about how each contrast between high school and college may apply to your academic experiences.</li>
      <li>By the end of this section, you should be able to discuss differences between high school and college and identify at least one personal implication of these differences.</li>
      <li>Ask family members or other acquaintances who have attended college to share their stories about grading and testing. Or, simply talk with family members about the possible implications of this information.</li>

          <strong>High School:</strong> Homework, quizzes, projects, and extra credit often raise a student’s overall grade when test grades are low because many assignments are averaged into the final grade.
        </p>
        <p>

            <li>Parents want to be kept in the loop, and those who are paying for college often feel that they have the right to access their student’s grades. You should work out this issue with your parents before you go to college. You need to know their expectations for being informed about your grades, and they need to know your expectations regarding privacy. It is helpful to be on the same page about these issues before going to college.</li>
            <li>It's best to keep your parents informed throughout the semester. Most students who do poorly in a class say that it's harder to tell their parents about their grades if they wait until the semester ends to drop the bomb.</li>

            <li>In college, students should seek help from many other resources in addition to the professor. Most colleges have tutoring centers, and many departments offer additional resources to help students. The ever-widening range of online resources and tutorials can also be helpful. A class may have a graduate assistant or teacher’s assistant, and classmates are often a valuable resource.</li>
            <li>In high school, students continue in school regardless of how poor their grades are. College students who do not maintain a certain grade point average are placed on academic probation or suspension. Keeping above the minimum GPA is essential to continuing to attend school.</li>

            <li>In college, it is usually up to the student to determine which information is important enough to appear on the test. Professors generally do not announce which material will be on the test. So, pay attention to the professor’s cues in lecture about what information is important; that'll help you to know what to study. Students who do not pay attention to these cues or who are overly selective when studying might walk away from a test saying, “I studied all the wrong things.”</li>

        Discuss with your student several ways that their involvement and attention in the college classroom might affect their success. A few implications that you may want to mention are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The value of completing all homework assignments and activities–even the ungraded ones. These activities are designed to contribute necessary knowledge and build proficiency for cumulative tests. Students should complete them even if they aren't graded or checked in class.</li>
        <li>The importance of attending all classes, if possible, since attendance often influences grades.</li>
        <li>The necessity of establishing and following a consistent study schedule that attempts to touch on each class, each day.</li>
        <li>The helpfulness of using the university’s Disability Support Services early each semester. Students can add supports later in the semester if needed, but it's best to begin using available supports early (even if those same supports were not used in high school), then eliminate what is not needed.</li>
