    This activity will focus on the skill of note-taking that successful college students
    learn. This is just a starting-off point. If your note-taking skills are not “up to
    par,” don’t worry! There is plenty of time to polish this skill.

      <li>In many college courses, material is presented via lecture. So note-taking is a
      very important skill to have at the start of your college career. Note-taking
      enables you to recall information at a later date, particularly for an exam.
      Good college note-taking habits include reviewing notes regularly, often
      within 24 hours after taking them; reciting key concepts from class; and
      connecting the lecture to the reading material. These habits, combined with
      active listening, can help you learn and retain large chunks of information.</li>
      <li>In high school, your teacher may have handed out notes, or provided guided
      notes, for you to highlight items and fill in the blanks.</li>
      <li>In college, it is rare for professors to provide notes to students; they're more
      likely to provide information via lecture. Some professors may provide
      PowerPoint slides prior to class, but this is not common and is often done
      only at the request of a student. In college, you will have the opportunity to
      try different note taking styles and strategies. You may even select different
      strategies depending upon the course content. For example, you may use
      one note-taking style in your psychology course and a totally different style
      in your biology course.</li>
      <li>Though some students hand-write their notes, others prefer to type them.
      Some professors encourage computer use in class, but others find computers
      distracting. Don’t be surprised if you’re required to use a pen and paper to
      take notes in class.</li>

      With a parent or family member, select one of the videos listed below and take notes
      using notebook paper. You may apply any note-taking strategy or style that you prefer.
      Anything is acceptable. When you're finished, compare the notes taken and see what
      each of you missed from the video lecture. Talk about what you could do to improve
      the notes you take.

This lecture gives a brief history of the young field of financial theory, which
began in business schools quite separate from economics, and of my growing
interest in the field and in Wall Street. [<a href="/stepp-program/assets/transcripts/family_modules/hs/one/part_four/financial_theory.pdf" target="_blank">Transcript</a>]

introduced, and the properties of electrical forces are compared with those of
other familiar forces, such as gravitation. [<a href="/stepp-program/assets/transcripts/family_modules/hs/one/part_four/fundamental_physics.pdf" target="_blank">Transcript</a>]

      Professor Donald Kagan explains why people should study the ancient Greeks.
      He argues that the Greeks are worthy of our study not only because of their
      vast achievements and contributions to Western civilization but also because
      they offer a unique perspective on humanity. [<a href="/stepp-program/assets/transcripts/family_modules/hs/one/part_four/Greek_Transcription.pdf" target="_blank">Transcript</a>]

        The categories listed above are suggested labels for the sections of your notebook.
        These are based on the information most incoming students receive from their
        colleges, but should be modified as necessary on an individual basis. Use this time to
        help your student think of other aspects of transition that could be included and help
        personalize this process for your student. During the college search process, students
        may want to create notebook sections based on each school they are seriously
        considering. Within each section, they would keep all of that school’s information,
        such as applications, brochures, flyers, maps, promotional materials, pros/cons lists,
        notes from visits, etc. You’ll continue adding to this notebook both in class and at
        home throughout the year.
