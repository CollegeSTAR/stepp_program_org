     Go to the website <a href="www.typingtest.com">www.typingtest.com</a>* and complete the typing test. You may take it 3 or 4 times to get a feel for the way the test works. Print your final results.
  </p>
  <p>
    Write a brief summary of your results, the challenges, and how you can work on getting faster and more efficient. Put the printout and your summary transition notebook.
