      <p>
      Expectations in college are likely to be different from what your student experienced in
      high school.
      </p>
      <p>
      There will be less direct guidance. Some of the rules and guidelines will be written or
      explicitly presented, but others will just be part of the university culture. It is up to your
      student to learn and follow all of these rules, guidelines, and expectations. Professors and
      administrators are not responsible for explicitly teaching students how to behave
      properly, but they will still hold students accountable for doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
      A general difference between high school and college underlies this issue: In high school,
      the assumption is that students need constant guidance to help shape and reinforce
      proper behaviors. In college, the assumption is that students can function reasonably well
      as adults without constantly being told what to do and reminded to do it.

      proper behaviors. In college, the assumption is that students can function reasonably well
      as adults without constantly being told what to do and reminded to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
      Students are also expected to behave with more maturity in college. Their maturity should
      be demonstrated by both their actions and their words.
      </p>
      <p>
      Demonstrating respect for both professionals and peers in the university setting is a
      cornerstone of college-level expectations. These demonstrations of respect can take many
      forms, but one of the most easily observed forms is the way a student participates in
      academic settings.

    Classroom disruptions are taken seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
    Colleges enforce policies on disruptive behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
    These policies exist to protect students who are investing time and money in
    their education.
    </p>
    <h1>Examples of disruptive behavior:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Repeatedly arriving late or leaving early to class or meetings</li>
      <li>Repeatedly entering and exiting the room during class</li>
      <li>Using cell phones or electronic devices in class (answering the phone, texting, or using technologies or electronics for other unauthorized purposes)</li>
      <li>Making loud or distracting noises</li>
      <li>Making exaggerated or distracting movements of oneself or one’s belongings</li>
      <li>Using disrespectful, insulting, profane, or otherwise inappropriate language</li>
      <li>Disrespecting or ridiculing others’ viewpoints</li>
      <li>Passing notes.</li>

  <div class="info_box">
    <p>
    Consequences vary from college to college and according to the severity and
    frequency of the disruption. Colleges have specific procedures that instructors
    must follow to deal with disruptive situations.
    </p>
    <h1>Consequences may include:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Being asked to cease the behavior in class</li>
      <li>Meeting with the instructor and/or department head</li>
      <li>Being asked to leave class and being counted absent</li>
      <li>Receiving a reduction in the course grade</li>
      <li>Receiving a verbal or written warning</li>
      <li>Receiving a formal charge of violation of the code of conduct</li>
      <li>Referral to a disciplinary board</li>
      <li>Permanent removal from class with a grade of "Withdrawn" or "Dropped"</li>
      <li>Probation, suspension, or expulsion.</li>

      <p>
      One of the most common pet peeves voiced by university instructors about classroom
      behavior is students' use of cell phones and other technology. Based on the feedback
      heard at many colleges, one of the best ways for your student to stay on your instructors’
      good side is to get in the habit of silencing his or her cell phone before walking into any
      classroom or meeting and putting it completely out of sight. Note that "silent" and
      "vibrate" are not the same thing; a buzzing phone pressed up against something hard in a
      backpack can make even more noise than a ringtone would.
      </p>
      <p>
      Assistive technology, when used appropriately in the classroom, does not fall into the
      category of disruptive behavior. However, assistive technology that is being misused (e.g.,
      using a permitted iPad to check Facebook instead of taking notes on it) may be governed
      by disruptive behavior policies.
      </p>
      <p>
      Whether or not a professor requires students to be recognized before speaking depends
      entirely on the context of the class. Some instructors stick to a "raise your hand and wait
      to be called on" approach, while others encourage students to call out questions or
      comments instead of raising their hand.

  </div>
    <h1>Pay attention to your school’s policies and culture, as well as individual instructors’ preferences.</h1>
    <p>
    First, pay attention to the do’s and don’t’s at your school. Secondly, develop
    good habits and practice strong self-control. This advice applies mostly to
    small things like forcing yourself to put your cellphone away before class and
    restraining yourself from checking Facebook during a boring lecture.
    </p>
    <h1>Practice self-control and develop good habits.</h1>
    <p>
    Meet with the instructor to address any concerns you have; if that doesn’t
    resolve your concerns, meet with the department chair.
    </p>
    <p>
    Every school has channels you can go through to get your concerns
    addressed, so seek out those channels and use them if you feel that you’re
    being treated unfairly regarding your classroom behavior.
    </p>
    <h1>Avoid any behaviors not directly related to classroom activity.</h1>
    <p>
    Finally, if you’re ever in doubt about what behavioral standards you should
    follow, simply avoid any behaviors that are not directly related to classroom
    activity.
