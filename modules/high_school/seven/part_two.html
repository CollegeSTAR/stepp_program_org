    <p>
    People are defined by what’s inside, not by their outward appearances.
    However, outward appearances play an important part in communicating with
    others. Appearances can create first impressions. Appearances can also
    quickly send specific signals to many people at once.
    </p>
    <p>
    Appearances can be deceiving. Strive to communicate clearly with your
    appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
    Also, be willing to past others’ appearances when they don’t use this form of
    communication effectively.

      <p>
      You may need to note that, for the purposes of this activity, we are using the term
      "physical appearance" to refer to how people personally dress and accessorize, their
      hygiene, their grooming, and other aspects of outward appearance that they have
      control over. We are not using this term to refer to people's physical features that
      they cannot easily alter.
      </p>
      <p>
      Thus, in discussing this activity, the emphasis should be on "making the most of
      what you have in order to send the messages you want to convey," and not on "the
      more attractive you are, the better." Because the topic of personal appearance can
      be a sensitive issue for some students, it may be beneficial to specifically point out
      this distinction and emphasize that dressing for success is not inherently tied to a
      person’s facial features, body type, weight, hair type, or other similar physical
      attributes.
      </p>
      <p>
      The issue of what physical attributes society finds attractive and values is a
      separate one that is beyond the scope of this activity.

      <li>Depending on the situation, do you think the person is dressed
      appropriately or socially acceptably? Why or why not?</li>
      <li>Does the person exhibit appropriate personal hygiene? Give an example

    <h1>Communicating Through Outward Appearance in College</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>College students use their outward appearances to communicate with
      peers, professors, employers, and many other people.</li>
      <li>College students need to be able to adjust their outward appearance to
      present themselves in different ways appropriate for a variety of
      situations, just as they use other forms of communication.</li>
      <li>Most colleges have no student dress code.</li>
      <li>Most college students dress primarily for comfort and personal style
      preferences.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To dress for success in college, you do not need to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Conform to specific styles or trends</li>
      <li>Suppress your self-expression</li>
      <li>Wear expensive clothing or accessories</li>
      <li>"Dress up" all the time</li>
      <li>Look picture-perfect every time you leave your doom room.</li>
    <p>You do need to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be clean and appropriately groomed</li>
      <li>Cover up enough to avoid indecency charges</li>
      <li>Dress appropriately for certain situations that require more formality</li>
      <li>Pay attention to the messages your appearance communicates to
          ensure these messages are what you want to convey.</li>
