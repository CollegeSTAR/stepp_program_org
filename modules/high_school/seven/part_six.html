    <h1>Writing Thank-You Notes</h1>
    <p>
    Writing thank-you notes is important when you want to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>acknowledge a kind gesture</li>
      <li>express appreciation</li>
      <li>make a positive impression.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    You may write thank-you notes for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gifts received</li>
      <li>Kindness shown</li>
      <li>References written</li>
      <li>Following up after a job or internship interview</li>
      <li>Other personal reasons.</li>
    </ul>

      <p>
      For many students, writing of any kind can be a challenging and daunting task.
      Writing something that seems "optional," like a thank-you note, can sometimes
      seem inconvenient or more difficult than it’s worth. Although handwritten thankyou
      notes are not as common as they once were, expressing gratitude in writing
      towards those who have done something for you is still an expected part of a
      successful adult’s communication skill set. Thus, writing thank-you notes is an
      important habit to develop.

  <h1>Thank-You Note Template</h1>

  <div class="info_box">
    <div class="image_wrapper">
      <i class="fa fa-volume-up" onclick="playAudio(this, '/assets/audio/high_school/module_seven/HSM7P6/HSM7P6_Thank You Note Template.MP3');"></i>
    </div>
    <h1>Thank-You Note Template</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Salutation.</li>
      <li>Directly say "thank you."</li>
      <li>Express your appreciation in more detail.</li>
      <li>Comment about how nice it was for the giver to do what they did for you.</li>
      <li>Closing niceties, such as well-wishes or greetings to others.</li>
      <li>Wrap up by thanking the giver one more time.</li>
      <li>Sign off.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    <strong>Step 1</strong> is the salutation. You may also think of this as the part where you
    greet or address the recipient.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Examples: "Dear Aunt Beth"; "Dear Professor Carver"; "Dear Dr. Smith"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Step 2</strong> is to directly thank the recipient. At this point, the template branches
    out to include instructions that are slightly different depending on whether
    you are writing a note about a gift or something intangible, like an action, an
    event, or a kindness.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gift example: "Thank you for the lovely watch you gave me for my
    birthday."</li>
      <li>Action or event example: "Thank you very much for writing letters of
    reference to accompany my scholarship applications."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Step 3</strong> is to express your appreciation in more specific detail. Tell the giver
    why you like the gift.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gift example: "The gift card will come in handy for buying coffee on the
    way to my morning classes."</li>
      <li>Action or event example: "I definitely think it strengthened my
    application for the committee to hear from someone who has taught
    me in a laboratory course."</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="image_wrapper">
    <img src="/assets/images/girl_taking_notes_in_library.jpg" alt="A girl writing a note in the library." />
  </div>
  <div class="info_box">
    <p>
    <strong>Step 4</strong> is to comment about what a nice, kind, or otherwise positive gesture the
    person's action was. This step can take many different forms depending on the
    specific gift, event, or circumstance.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Example: "It was so thoughtful of you to remember me. What a generous
    and kind gift!"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Step 5</strong> is some type of nice closing statement. This might include a greeting to
    others in the family, a comment about an upcoming event you know they’ll be
    involved in, or just general well-wishes. This will vary drastically depending on
    your relationship with the giver and the context of the thank-you note.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Example: "I hope you and Uncle Lloyd are doing well and enjoying your
    summer. Please send my love to cousin Marcus. Let’s plan to get together
    next time I’m in town."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Step 6</strong> is to simply directly say "thanks" one more time.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Examples: "Thanks again!" or "Thank you for the opportunity."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <strong>Step 7</strong> is to end with an appropriate sign-off.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Examples: "Love, Wilbur"; "Warm Regards, John "; "Best Wishes, Emily."</li>
    </ul>

    Dear Professor Smith:
    </p>
    <p>
    Thank you for writing letters of reference to accompany my scholarship
    applications. I definitely think it strengthened my application for the
    committee members to hear from someone who has taught me in a
    laboratory course. I really appreciate your taking the time to recommend me,
    especially at such a busy time of the year. I hope the rest of your semester
    goes well, and I’ll keep you posted about whether I receive any of the
    scholarships. Thanks again!

    Dear Aunt Bethany,
    </p>
    <p>
    Thank you so much for the awesome care package you sent to me at school!
    My roommate and I are having a great time playing with the stress-ball toys,
    and I think I made some new friends on my hall by sharing a few of your
    amazing homemade cookies. (The rest are safely stashed under my bed to
    make sure they last as long as possible!) You must have known that I was
    having a stressful time, because it was exactly the kind of fun pick-me-up that I
    needed to turn my whole week around for the better. Thank you so much for
    both the treats and the sweet note, and I can’t wait to give you a big hug when
    I see you over winter break!
    </p>
    <p>
    Love,<br>
    Alice

    <p>
    Write a thank-you note in response to one of the scenarios listed below. Follow
    the template provided above, but personalize your note as you see fit. Feel
    free to make up any details that are not included in the scenario description.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Scenario 1:</strong>You just interviewed for a very competitive summer internship at a
    bank in your hometown. Write a thank-you note expressing your gratitude to
    the bank president who interviewed you for the position.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Scenario 2:</strong> You have been working with a professional tutor at a local learning
    center for the past two years. As a result of this intensive tutoring, you made a
    C in a course that you weren’t sure you’d be able to pass before starting
    tutoring. You just graduated from high school, and this tutor attended your
    graduation party. Write a note to thank the tutor for everything he has done
    for you.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Scenario 3:</strong> You are applying to several universities. One of your teachers
    wrote you a letter of recommendation for admission and completed a
    recommendation form for each school you applied to. Write this teacher a
    thank-you note expressing your appreciation for serving as a reference.
    </p>
    <p>
    Write your thank-you note below. You may also type your thank-you note using
