      Why does communication matter, and how does your student learn to use it effectively?
      </p>
      <p>
      Talk about communication-related expectations will change as your student becomes and
      adult and enters college.
      </p>
      <p>
      Discuss the effects of using appropriate communication, and how other people are more
      likely to
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have a positive impression of you</li>
        <li>Take you seriously; relate to you as a peer and adult</li>
        <li>Offer you assistance and give you the benefit of the doubt when needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Informal communication is appropriate in many circumstances. However, college students
      encounter more situations where formal communication is necessary and appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>
      In college, your student will need to transition back and forth between formal and informal
      communication styles much more frequently than they might have done in high school.

  <h1>College Communication</h1>

    </div>
    <h1>In college, you will probably need to:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Send emails: These will go to a variety of people; some of them will need to be very formal, while others will be much more casual.</li>
      <li>Leave voicemails: Not every situation can be handled over email, so you’ll need to have strong phone skills as well.</li>
      <li>Attend meetings: A much broader array of people can be involved in your education during college than in high school, and you may have meetings with many of them at one time or another. You’ll need to schedule these meetings, attend them, and often follow up with additional communication in different formats. In addition, because there will be a wide range of people involved, you’ll likely need to use different levels of formality and different communication strategies in each.</li>
     <li>Ask questions: You will need to ask questions effectively in class, but also in
    many other situations, especially during your first couple years in college.
    You may need to walk into a completely unfamiliar office and ask a total
    stranger for information. Some students find these situations intimidating,
    but practicing strong communication skills can help make them easier.</li>
    <li>Write papers and assignments: Writing is a typical way that students are
    assessed in college. Your ability to represent yourself well in academic
    writing, which is a completely different style than other types of writing,
    will be important to your college success.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="image_wrapper">

      <img src="/assets/images/classroom_lecture.jpg" alt="A professor lecturing to her class." />
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Give presentations. Depending on your major, you may have lots of oral
      presentations in your classes or only a few. Either way, becoming a stronger public
      speaker is an excellent skill to develop.</li>
      <li>Attend tutoring and other support sessions: Most college campuses offer many
      types of academic support, and even the strongest students access these
      resources. You’ll need to be able to interact with tutors, professors, graduate
      assistants, peers, and others who will be involved in these sessions.</li>
      <li>Participate in class discussions: Some college courses are strongly discussionbased,
      and your grade may even derive from your appropriate participation and
      effective, relevant contributions to class conversations.</li>
      <li>Work on group projects: College students often have strong feelings about working
      on group projects, often because their grade is partly based on the work other
      students submit. Effective communication is the key to successful group project
      experiences. Don’t underestimate the impact that one strong communicator (you)
      can have on bringing a group together successfully.</li>
      <li>Apply and interview for a job or internship: For many students, college includes a
      part-time job or an internship. At the very least, students preparing to graduate
      will need to develop their communication skills related to applying for and
      interviewing for jobs.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Stand up (or sit up) straighter than usual.</li>

    <h1>Use active listening skills</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Pay attention and actively try to understand what’s being said.</li>

      College is the first time that many students tackle many of the independent living tasks that
      their parents may have handled previously. The transition often involves more extensive
      interactions with people outside of the university setting. For example, your student will use
      communication skills to schedule appointments, to make purchases, and for other
      purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
      Discuss each of these situations with your student, emphasizing the importance of
      presenting themselves in an intelligent, polished manner to the people they will interact
      with. If you have typically taken the lead in interactions when your student is with you, now
      is a good time to allow your student to practice doing the talking in different types of
      settings, especially educational settings.
      </p>
      <p>
      This may also be a good time to practice shaking hands with your student. Have your
      student shake your hand and introduce himself or herself. This skill will come in handy when
      they meet people for the first time upon arriving at college.

    <h1>Read the following scenario and discuss the accompanying questions with your parent:</h1>
    <p>
    Imagine that you are the professor of an Intro to Anthropology course. On the first day of the
    semester, a student approaches you before class. He shakes your hand and introduces himself:
    </p>
    <p>
    "Hello, Dr. James. My name is Charlie Hunt. I’m really looking forward to your class. I’m a
    psychology major, but I’m thinking of minoring in anthropology. If I have any questions this
    semester, would it be okay if I emailed you about them, or do you prefer a different way of
    getting in touch?"
    </p>
    <p>
    As you wrap up your conversation, he says, "Oh, by the way, here’s a copy of my disability
    support services accommodations letter. I’ll be using a few accommodations in your class, and
    you can contact either me or the disability office if you have any questions about them."
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What type of first impression has Charlie made on you, as the instructor of this course?</li>
      <li>What is that first impression based on?</li>
      <li>What might you predict Charlie will be like during the rest of the semester based on your first encounter with him?</li>

        [Have your student discuss Charlie’s first impression. Compare your student's comments to
        the following potential description: Charlie has made a very positive first impression. He is
        memorable and stands out in the class. He seems to take initiative, and he is polite.]</li>
        <li>What is that first impression based on?
        [Have your student discuss how they he or she formed that first impression of Charlie.
        Compare this response to the following possibilities: The impression may be based on
        Charlie’s conversation with the professor; the way he took the initiative to introduce himself;
        how he came prepared with his disability accommodations letter; how he used respectful
        language and good manners.]</li>

        your first encounter with him?</li>

      following: Charlie is likely to be a responsible, well-mannered student who communicates
      clearly and effectively and participates appropriately in class.]
