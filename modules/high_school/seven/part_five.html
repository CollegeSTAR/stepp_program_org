    According to Wikipedia, constructive criticism is the process of offering valid
    and well-reasoned opinions about the work of others, usually involving both
    positive and negative comments, in a friendly manner rather than an
    oppositional one. In collaborative work, this kind of criticism is often a
    valuable tool in raising and maintaining performance standards.
    </p>
    <p>
    Notice some key elements to this definition:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Valid and well-reasoned opinions</li>
      <li>Includes both positive and negative comments</li>
      <li>Friendly manner rather than an oppositional one</li>
      <li>Valuable tool in raising and maintaining performance standards.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    While most of us don’t enjoy hearing ways in which we can improve,
    constructive criticism is designed to be positive and used for growth.

    <h1>Communication styles differ in high school and college</h1>
    <p>
    High school teachers' criticisms
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Goals include increasing students' self-esteem and correcting errors.</li>
      <li>They may be less direct when giving feedback or assessing work. College professors' criticisms</li>
      <li>Goals are to correct errors and increase proficiency.</li>
      <li>They may be more direct or straightforward in giving feedback.</li>
      <li>They may not mention what was done well.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Communication styles are going to differ from high school to college. In high
    school, teachers are often less direct (or more gentle) than college professors
    in their assessment of students’ work. High school feedback might focus on
    encouraging the student and building the student's self-esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
    In college, professors do care about students' feelings and self-esteem, but
    they may blend this concern with more direct assignment feedback. Their
    feedback is generally straightforward and direct, with the goal of correcting
    errors or problems with an assignment. They may not mention what the
    student did well. This does not mean that nothing was done well; it just was
    not the focus of the feedback. Professors may also be trying to push students
    to the "next level" of proficiency or ability, which means that even something
    that is done well may be given feedback on how to improve it even further.
    </p>
    <p>
    Many college students are unprepared for this kind of feedback, and receiving
    it may create "culture shock."

      </div>
      <p>
      Discuss the benefits of constructive criticism with your student. Sometimes
      constructive criticism may be interpreted as a personal attack if your student doesn’t
      understand its purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
      Remind your student that professors are not launching a personal attack by giving
      them direct feedback. Professors do not have a vendetta against students. They are
      there for the student. Their job is to make your student a stronger critical thinker, a
      better writer, and a more knowledgeable person. They have the benefit of experience
      and perspective to offer quality feedback and advice.
      </p>
      <p>
      Your student will not improve without hearing where he or she went wrong and how
      to correct it.
      </p>
      <p>
      Don’t know what to say? Try this:
      </p>
      <p>
      "Keep this in mind: Nobody has ever gotten to be the best at anything without getting
      feedback from other people about how they could improve. This applies to anything
      from writing a paper to shooting a basketball. It even applies to less tangible things like
      making life decisions and choosing friends. In everything we do, we need help from the
      people around us to improve. We cannot see our own behaviors and the things we
      create in the same objective way that other people can see them."
      </p>

      <p>
      If a professor has given a lot of feedback on a paper or project, it can be overwhelming
      to a student, especially if that student has put forth a lot of effort into doing a good job.
      Encourage your student to pause and take a deep breath, then begin to digest the
      feedback piece by piece instead of seeing the project as a complete failure. This will help
      your student to process the suggestions and make changes to become better.

    <p>
    Some criticism may have a big impact on you. It may sometimes be personal, and it often feels personal.

    <p>
    It’s okay to feel hurt, angry, sad, disappointed, stung, surprised, or whatever else.

    </p>
    <h1>Scenario</h1>
    <p>
    You have had a crazy week at school. You had two tests, one group project, and
    one paper due within the same week. On top of that, you work 12 hours a week,
    and your roommate has been sick. Even though you prepared in advance for all
    this work, you have still felt overwhelmed. You feel like you put a lot of effort
    into making sure you did your best work on the paper, but when you got the
    paper back, you received a C, and it’s covered with red corrections that are
    blunt and, in your opinion, very picky.

    <ul>
      <li>How would the criticism affect you? Why would it impact you in this manner?</li>
      <li>Describe 3 concrete ways in which you would process this criticism and turn it into a positive learning experience.</li>
