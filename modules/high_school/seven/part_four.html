      <li>Email skills are very important in college. Email is the primary method of
      communication between students and university faculty and staff.</li>
      <li>Although you might not use email frequently for communicating with
      your friends and family, on most college campuses, email is the primary
      way that the university disseminates information to its students. It is also
      the primary way in which students communicate with faculty and staff
      outside of class. (Source: Kolowich, S. [2001])</li>
      <li>When you send an email, you communicate information beyond the
      content of your message. The person who reads your email will notice
      how it is written in addition to what you have written. Although the
      "what" is fairly straightforward, the "how" can have many facets,
      including your writing style, the tone of your message, the vocabulary you
      use, whether the email is polite, the clarity of your message, and your use
      of correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation.</li>
      <li>Based on both the content and the other elements of your email, the
      recipient will form an impression of you, either for better or for worse.
      That is especially true when the person you’re emailing doesn’t already
      know you. When your email is the recipient's first impression of you, it
      can be an extremely influential part of the recipient's ultimate opinion of
      you. The recipient might draw conclusions about your communication
      skills, your abilities as a student, your professionalism, your level of
      maturity, how seriously you take your education, and more.</li>
      <li>Even if you are an excellent student who is invested in your education, a
      careless email can give the wrong impression to your professors.
      Recipients might also misconstrue your meaning (content) based on the
      way your email is written. Although it’s possible to create the wrong
      impression, with care, you can create the right impression. By using
      appropriate email etiquette and paying careful attention to how you
      compose emails to faculty and staff, you can ensure that you
      communicate what you want to communicate.</li>

    </div>
    <p>It’s fine to use certain types of standard abbreviations in your email. In fact,
    many of these are necessary and appropriate. For example, you might not want
    to write out, "I’m in your Psychology 101 course, section 3." It would be more
    appropriate to use the standard university abbreviation for that course, such as
    "I’m in your PSYC 101-003 course." Many abbreviations may be specific to your
    university or campus, such as "UNC" for University of North Carolina or
    "MWF" and "TR" for Monday-Wednesday-Friday and Tuesday-Thursday classes.
    </p>
    <p>
    However, skip the informal or "textese" abbreviations. The purpose of using
    abbreviations is to clearly convey something more quickly, and you can’t assume
    that your professors will know all of these acronyms. In many cases, they also
    come across as unprofessional.
    </p>
    <p>
    Pay attention to your punctuation and capitalization in emails. Make sure you’ve
    used commas, periods, and other punctuation marks to punctuate your
    sentences correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
    Receiving an email that neglects punctuation and reads like one continuous, runon
    sentence is an immediate red flag to a professor. Also keep in mind that
    professional correspondence rarely needs many exclamation points. If you really
    need to emphasize a thought, a single "!" should be sufficient. In addition, avoid
    writing anything in all capitals. Using all-caps is the written equivalent of
    screaming. If you wouldn’t scream the content at someone, then don’t write it in
    all-caps. If you need to emphasize a single word or phrase, use bold, underline,
    or italics instead. Even changing the text color to something more noticeable is
    preferable to all-caps.

      <p>
      Encourage your student to write emails using standard English and complete
      sentences, along with professional vocabulary.
      </p>
      <p>
      Your student’s emails should not read the same way as his or her text messages. Emails
      should also not be written as bulleted points unless there is a good reason to do so
      (e.g., if you’re sending information that is best communicated as a list).
      </p>
      <p>
      Finally, encourage your student to avoid slang or overly informal language. An email
      message may sound somewhat stilted when you read it aloud, but it's best to err on
      the side of formality.

    </div>
    <p>
    In the "meat" of your message, you should strike a balance between providing
    detailed enough information without reaching information overload. Certain key
    information should always be included, such as the course and section number
    you’re in, your full name, and what you need from the recipient. You don’t want
    the recipient to finish your email and still wonder who you are, where they know
    you from, or what you want. But it’s equally important not to waste time by
    sharing too much detail. If you have something that needs a lot of explanation,
    you should use your email to request an appointment to discuss the matter
    either face-to-face or on the phone.
    </p>
    <p>
    One of the most challenging aspects of writing good emails in the college setting
    is getting the tone right. It’s difficult to convey tone in emails, and you need to
    make sure that you’re coming across as respectful and professional, but not
    robotic and distant. The language you choose and the way you phrase things
    makes a big difference. It's helpful to enlist a trusted friend to read over your
    emails and share their impression until you get the hang of how to create the
    right tone.
    </p>
    <p>
    You should also pay attention to language that may be emotionally-laden or
    overdramatic, or that could put the recipient on the defensive. If the emotional
    tone of your email elicits this type of reaction, it’s less likely to lead to a helpful
    response or to the results you want.
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally, remember that emails can be easily (and even accidentally) forwarded to
    others, so be careful about what you say. Ideally, you shouldn’t include anything
    in an email that you wouldn’t want shared with others. Since you may sometimes
    need to email professors or other university personnel about personal matters,
    that may not always be avoidable. However, you can avoid sending emails with
    any content that you may regret due to poor choice of words, disrespect, or
    emotionality.

    </div>
    <p>
    Always run a spell-check and grammar-check before sending your emails. In fact,
    see whether your email server can be set up to automatically run spell-check
    before sending your emails. However, remember that spell-check and
    grammar-check don’t catch everything, and they can even sometimes make
    erroneous suggestions. Be sure to proofread your email yourself before sending it.
    If you struggle to identify your own writing errors, have someone else proofread
    your emails for you, especially if they’re particularly important (e.g., regarding a
    job interview, a scholarship, or college acceptance).
    </p>
    <p>
    Be sure that you always include your name in your email, or set up an email
    signature that automatically appends to the bottom of every email you send.
    Professors rarely have the time to sit around trying to guess the identity of
    "bballdude22@emailserver.com." This is doubly important if you’re not using your
    official university email address to communicate with someone from the
    university. At least if they have your school email address, they can probably see
    your name in the directory. But you should still assume that recipients can’t, and
    include your full name in the body or signature of the email. Although it may seem
    strange to include some of these details when emailing a professor you see in
    class every week, keep in mind that it’s very common for professors to recognize
    their students by face but have difficulty putting the name and face together
    unless they’ve had significant contact with the student outside of class setting.
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally, it’s perfectly acceptable to indicate if an email is urgent or needs a reply.
    This can be a helpful way for busy university personnel to prioritize. For example,
    if an email subject line reads "Question about tomorrow’s test," a professor can
    see at first glance that it might need to move to the top of his list to reply to.
    Some email programs even have a little "urgent" indicator that you can click to
    flag the message in the recipient’s inbox. However, do not abuse this feature!Your
    instructors are not sitting in front of their emails all day. If you don’t get a
    response immediately, either wait or try a different method of communication.

    <h1>Additional email etiquette</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Check your email frequently and reply promptly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Since email will most likely be the primary way that your school officials and professors
    communicate with you, it’s very important to get in the habit of checking your email
    frequently. You will also need to reply to emails promptly if they need a response. It’s a good
    idea to set up a folder system in your email so you can keep only the emails that still need to
    be dealt with in your inbox and then move the ones that you’ve already replied to or acted
    on into other folders. This will help you to avoid losing track of messages that you still need
    to do something with.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pay attention to "Reply" versus "Reply All."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Be aware of whether you’re clicking "reply" or "reply all" when responding to an email.
    Depending on who sent the email and who else was on the recipient list, it’s all too easy to
    accidentally send something intended only for your professor to your entire class. Depending
    on the content of your email, the result of doing so can range from simply inconvenient and
    inconsiderate to extremely embarrassing.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Once an email dialogue is underway, some aspects of your responses may become less formal.</li>
      <li>Use the "reply" feature instead of starting a new email so you don’t have to repeat all the background information each time.</li>
      <li>Depending on your relationship with the recipient, it might be appropriate to use more informal salutations, less context, or slightly more casual language.</li>
      <li>However, some aspects of your writing—especially tone, correct spelling and grammar, and respectful language—should remain formal.</li>
      <li>Once you’ve gone back and forth in an email exchange a few times, you may be able to
      reduce the level of formality. Some aspects of emailing can become more relaxed fairly
      quickly. For example, once you’re certain that a professor knows who you are, you can
      likely drop the detailed context in each email. If it’s someone with whom you have a
      closer relationship (e.g., a long-term advisor instead of a new professor), you may even
      be able to use more casual language or informal greetings. However, some aspects of
      emailing should never become casual in the university setting. Always maintain an
      appropriately professional tone, use respectful language, and use good spelling,
      grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure.</li>

      Discuss with your student the problems presented by Cameron’s email, including:

        <li>There’s no subject line.</li>
        <li>The salutation is extremely informal.</li>
        <li>The professor might not know the student and the email doesn’t include a last name.</li>
        <li>Professors teach several classes each day. There isn’t any way for this professor to know which class Cameron missed. Therefore, he or she doesn’t know what slides to send.</li>
        <li>The incorrect grammar, punctuation, and informal writing may give the impression that the student isn’t serious about school.</li>
        <li>Cameron doesn't list an excused reason for why he missed class.</li>
        <li>The professor isn’t required to send notes to a student who missed
        class. To do so is an exception to the rule. If the student wants the
        notes missed in class, he should make a very good case for why he
        needs them and why he missed class.</li>

    Using your computer, draft an email in response to the scenario below. Remember to
    use the guidelines discussed in this lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
    Scenario: You are registering for spring semester classes. Last week you met with your
    academic advisor to discuss the courses you will need to take in the spring, and you also
    spent time developing your preferred schedule. One of the classes you had planned to
    take is now full, and you are not sure if you should ask for special permission to be
    added to that class or if you should just select something else. If you need to select
    another course, you are not sure which one to select. Compose an email to your advisor
    to ask for guidance with this decision.
