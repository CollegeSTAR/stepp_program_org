    Imagine that I have just handed you a box containing a 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle, 
    and you are going to assemble it.
    </p>
    <p>
    What is the <strong><em>very first step</em></strong> you will take?
    </p>
    <p>
    You probably said something like sort the pieces by color or find all the edge pieces&hellip;but the very first thing you likely would do is to look at the picture on the box to figure out what the puzzle is supposed to look like when it’s done!
    </p>
    <p>
    Now imagine that you look at the box&hellip;but there’s no picture! 
    </p>
    <p>
    How does that change the situation?
    </p>
    <p>
    Not having a picture makes the task more difficult.  Normally you’d rely on the picture of the completed puzzle to guide you, but now you can’t do it.  It won’t be impossible to complete the puzzle, but it will definitely be more challenging.

    <p>
In some ways, college life is a lot like assembling a large jigsaw puzzle.
    </p>

    <div class="image_wrapper">

    </div>

    <p>
    To be a successful college student, you have to fit together all the pieces of your life, such as friends, classes, activities, hobbies, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
    Just like with a real jigsaw puzzle, it is easier to figure out where each piece belongs if you have an idea of what the end result is supposed to look like.
    </p>
    <p>
    To create your own “puzzle picture,” you just need to know what your big goals are and have a sense of what is important to you so that you can tell whether you are putting each piece in the right place. 
    </p>
    <p>
    You’re not expected to have a detailed mental picture of your future yet!  Adults often revise their goals and mental picture of their future.
    </p>
    <p>
    So&hellip;You don’t need to have all of the details worked out yet (even in college, this picture will still be a work in progress). You just need to have a general idea of where you’re headed and what your priorities are in order to ensure that you’re pointed in the right direction and making good choices.

      <li>Brainstorm the different “pieces” that you expect to be part of your college life.   You can pull some of this information from your goal setting worksheet.  Examples of possible “pieces” in each category include:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Academic</strong>: Attending classes, homework/studying, tutoring, organization/time management, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Social</strong>: Friends, family, hobbies/interests, events and entertainment, campus organizations, etc.</li>

      <li>Decide how you will arrange your pieces and enter them on your puzzle grid.</li>
