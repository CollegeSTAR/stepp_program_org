  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p><i class="fa fa-eye"></i> <strong>Objective:</strong> The student will plan and cook a nutritious meal for his or her family.
  </p>
  <p>
  <em>This lesson is designed to prepare you to cook a simple meal. Even though many first‐year college students rarely cook because they have meal plans, cooking is still an important skill to develop before you leave home. If you live off campus, you’re likely to need to cook on a somewhat regular basis.</em>

    <h1>Cooking 101</h1>
    <p>
    Basic cooking skills include the ability to: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand basic nutrition and identify healthy meal options</li>
      <li>Follow simple recipes and understand cooking instructions and terms</li>
      <li>Learn about food safety and kitchen safety.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    If you do not already have these skills, start hanging around the kitchen and asking questions when your family prepares meals! You don’t need to become a gourmet chef before you go to college; some basic cooking skills will suffice. After all, you do want to eat, and the dining hall may not appeal to you for every meal!

      Some children already cook meals for themselves or their families; others have hardly ever used a stove. Adapt this activity for the skill level of your child. For example, if your child has more experience, he or she may not need parental guidance to get started; with less experience, he or she may need to be walked through the entire process.
      </p>
      <p>
      Help to find a recipe that would be simple enough for your student to prepare on his or her own at college. Let your student do the grocery shopping and the cleanup. It will be a nice treat for you!
