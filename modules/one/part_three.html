  <div class="info_box">
    <ul>
      <li>In Part III of the High School vs. College module, we will discuss the important concept of studying in college.</li>
      <li>Time management is also a key concept. In this lesson, students will develop a weekly schedule for themselves that considers some differences in time and other variables.</li>
      <li>Family members or other acquaintances who have attended college are encouraged to share their stories about studying and time management. Or, students and their families might simply talk about what they think the implications are for each comparison in the information provided.</li>

        <h1>Study Time</h1>
        <p>
         <strong>High School:</strong> Study time outside of the classroom varies and may be as little as 1–3 hours per week per class. Some classes may only require last-minute test preparation to succeed.
       </p>
       <p>
         <strong>College:</strong> Students generally need to study at least 2–3 hours outside of class for each hour in class. A 12-hour course load will require 24–36 hours of studying per week.

            <li>In high school, most learning occurs in the classroom. Students are generally not expected to spend a large amount of time on schoolwork outside of class.</li>
            <li>In college, most learning occurs outside of the classroom.</li>
            <li>Students who follow the "2-3 hours per hour" rule of thumb actually spend a lot more time on schoolwork than they did in high school, even though they are spending less time in class.</li>

        <h1>Reading</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>High School:</strong> Students are expected to read short assignments that are then discussed and retaught in class. Students seldom need to read anything more than once, and sometimes just listening in class is enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>College:</strong> Substantial amounts of assigned reading may never be directly addressed in class. Students need to review class notes and reading assignments regularly.
        </p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <ul>
            <li>Students sometimes fall into the trap of thinking that if a topic was not addressed in class, they needn't learn it. That may be true in high school, but it is not true in college. Professors may assign reading that will appear on a test even though they never lecture on it.</li>
            <li>In addition, some supplemental reading may never appear on a test in that class, but it may be critical to understanding concepts in a later course that builds upon the current class.</li>
            <li>This goes along with the need to spend 2-3 hours studying for every hour in class.</li>
            <li>Students will be more successful if they study each subject a little bit every day. Spreading out the review for a class is called “distributed practice,” in contrast to “mass practice,” in which students attempt to study for the class in one marathon session. Distributed practice is much more effective for long-term retention of information.</li>

          <h1>Independent Learning</h1>
          <p>        
           <strong>High School:</strong> Students are usually explicitly told what they should be learning from assigned readings.
         </p>
         <p>
         <strong>College:</strong> It is up to the student to read the assigned material and draw conclusions from it. Professors lecture and make assignments based on the assumption that students have

          <ul>
            <li>Students need to be independent learners in college. It is up to students to figure out what is important in the lecture and reading, and to use their critical thinking skills to analyze it.</li>
            <li>College professors will assume that students have already read and understand the material before class, and students who have not done so are likely to be at a significant disadvantage in class.</li>
