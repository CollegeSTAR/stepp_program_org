    <p>
    In the early 1980’s, Choose Your Own Adventure books were written, and they became a huge hit. In these books, the reader could make choices about what should happen next. Based on those decisions, the book took different twists and turns. The book could have a completely different plot based on what the reader chose to do. The challenges, adventure, and victories would be different just because of choices.
    </p>
    <p>
    Our lives are the same way. In our day to day activities, we have to make choices. These decisions may have to be made quickly, but sometimes we can plan them out in advance. Just like the books, our choices will lead to different challenges, adventures, and victories.
    </p>

    Sometimes the decisions that we need to make can be overwhelming. In these situations, being prepared can give us confidence in the decisions that we are making. Today you have a chance to practice making decisions that you might face in high school by completing your own Choose Your Own Adventure.

    This can be a very fun activity with a lot of different scenarios. It might be fun for you and your child to both do the activity separately from each other and then compare your results. Talk about why you made your choices and how they affected the story.

    It’s time to get started. Make sure you have your copy of the Choose Your Own Adventure Reflection Guide. Click here to get started. You can always do it more than once if you want to check out the other options.
    </p>
    <p>
    When you are finished, use the second page of the Reflection Guide to help you apply the results of this activity to your own high school decisions. This is the most important part of the activity. Spend some time thinking about the decisions that you will want to make, and how those decisions will impact your high school career and beyond. Make sure that you share the results with your parent or guardian!

    The activity is meant to be fun, but it’s even more important that your child can apply the activity to his or her life. Take the time to complete the second page of the reflection guide with your child. Walking through important decisions now will make those same decisions much more seamless when the time comes to actually make them. Use the knowledge gained from other lessons to help with these decisions. Most importantly, spend time listening to your child. Authentic conversations are the first step to a successful high school career.
