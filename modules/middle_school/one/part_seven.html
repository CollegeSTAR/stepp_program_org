  <h1>Learn About It</h1>
  <div class="info_box">
    <p>
    When people put on a performance of some sort, they want it to look easy and flawless. They want you to see the final, polished product. When they make it look simple, it’s very easy to forget that it probably took a lot of hard work, effort, and a team of people to put it all together.
    </p>
    <p>
    As you saw in the previous video, it takes an entire team of people spending countless hours to pull off an event. Even your teacher puts in hours of planning and preparation to make the classes that you take interesting and engaging.
    </p>
    <p>
    The same thing is true of your life. You might not have recognized it yet, but you have a team of people who are working behind the scenes every day on your behalf. It might be a smaller team and perhaps a little less glamorous than the team for a rock star, but your team is just as important. As you go through this activity, you will identify your team members, the roles that they play, and a few items that you will need to take responsibility for completing in the future.

  You have been caring for your child since the day he or she was born. Some things come naturally and easily; others are a bit of a strain. Most middle school students are not at a developmental stage where they can naturally recognize all that others do for them. Don’t get frustrated if your child doesn’t realize all the things you do for him or her. Instead, begin to point out these things so it can become a springboard for conversation.

    Think of the things that you have to do every day, then think of the things that others do for you. Though you might have a lot of responsibility, there are still people taking care of you. Check out this Powtoon video to jumpstart your thoughts about some of the things that others do for you.

    That video gave you some initial ideas about who might be on your team and what they’re doing for you. Now, list the people in your life who make up your support network and what they do for you. Some people to consider are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Parents: Give medicine, schedule appointments, offer reminders, wake you up, make your meals, do your laundry</li>
      <li>Teachers: Schedule tests, map out assignments, ensure accommodations are in place, think about how to capitalize on your strengths</li>
      <li>Friends: Text or phone reminders, share notes</li>
      <li>Tutors: Research sample problems, check into college options.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Now that you have your list of the people in your support network, you’ll interview those people to learn exactly what they do for you. Use this form to help organize your findings.

    Review your child’s list to see if there is anyone or anything to add or remove. You might be surprised by what your child realizes about the things that are done for him or her.

  <h1>Time for Practice</h1>
  <div class="info_box">
    <p>
    As you review your list with your parent or another adult, look specifically at some of the things that others do for you. Think about yourself as a future 9th grader or high school student. Is there anything on the list that you can begin doing for yourself as you step closer to attending high school?
    </p>
    <p>
    Reflect on the background supports you have in place, like knowing that someone will wake you up in the morning. Determine the existing supports that you will likely need in the long term. How can you find out where those supports can be found in high school, in a university setting, or in a work environment, depending on your post-secondary goals? Determine what you will eventually need to do independently. Sort these items into two categories: responsibilities that you’ll need to address later and responsibilities that you can begin sharing (or even fully assume) now.
    </p>
    <p>
    Examples of things you might begin doing yourself now include doing laundry at home, setting an alarm to wake up in the morning, and maintaining a calendar (maybe in partnership with parents at this point).
    </p>
    <p>
    Select one item from the scavenger hunt results that you will begin to assume (or at least to practice) by yourself over the next few months.

    You’ve done it! You have completed all of the family lessons for this information! Just to make sure that you’ve gotten the hang of your support network, see if you can answer these questions based on all that you have learned:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Who works behind the scenes for you?</li>
      <li>What do the members of your team do for you?</li>
      <li>What can you take responsibility for doing for yourself in the near future?</li>
