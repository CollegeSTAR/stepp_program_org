  <h1>Learn About It</h1>
  <div class="info_box">
    <p>
Self-disclosure is a process in which a person reveals or communicates information about him/her self to another person. In this case, the information disclosed is about ones learning style and/or learning difference. Students may wish to talk to a parent, teacher, counselor, or other learning ally about how they learn in regard to being successful in the academic setting. 
</p>
<p>
Listen to the podcast from Patrick, Joy, Jonathan, and Emily on their experiences with self-disclosing in college and think about how you might self-disclose in high school. Discuss with your parent or guardian using the reflection questions below.

    <h1>Parents Chime In</h1>
    <p>
    Talk with your child about experiences or challenges you have had with self-disclosing information to others. It can sometimes feel uncomfortable or awkward for students to have to talk (excluding parents/guardians) about how they learn and what they need to learn best. Explain to them that it is okay to feel this way in the beginning, that with practice it will become easier to talk to others about their learning differences.
